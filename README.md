Just a way of deploying a static website to netlify simulating 3 different environment, like development, staging and production.
The development environment is free for developers to test their codes and check if anything is wrong and needs to be fixed while the staging environment needs an approver for it to publish and it can be used by the testers and QA to test the site for any challenges.
finally, before the work goes live, the production environment is protected and so it does not trigger automatically, it need a reviewer to manually trigger the deployment to this environment
